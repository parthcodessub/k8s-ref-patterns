# ClusterRole: defines the permissions the Collector needs to query cluster
# state for service discovery. These permissions are intentionally narrow:
# - `get`, `list`, `watch` on `pods` and `nodes` so the Collector can discover
#   pod metadata (annotations, pod IPs) and node topology used by kubernetes_sd_configs.
# Keep this role minimal (least-privilege) and avoid granting admin-level verbs.
